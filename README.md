#University of Richmond - Schedule Generator

##What It Is
Our app accepts as many courses as a student may want to take along with all the offered sections of each course.  Then, with
our algorithm, generates all possible non-conflicting schedules.

##Where It Is
Right now the PHP version is available at http://mikedombrowski.com/ur/.
We are currently still developing the Java version which will then be used to make the Android version.

##Theory of Operation
Our algorithm is essentially a recursive tree, which is explained more in the image below.

# University of Richmond - Schedule Generator

## What It Is
Our app accepts as many courses as a student may want to take along with all the offered sections of each course.  Then, with
our algorithm, generates all possible non-conflicting schedules.

## Where It Is
Right now the PHP version is available at http://mikedombrowski.com/ur/.
We are currently still developing the Java version which will then be used to make the Android version.

## PHP API Documentation
Available at https://md100play.github.io/university-schedule-generator/html/index.html

## Theory of Operation
Our algorithm is essentially a recursive tree, which is explained more in the image below.

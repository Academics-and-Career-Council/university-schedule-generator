We will explore these questions and others from many disciplinary perspectives, including philosophy, sociology, psychology, literature, and neuroscience.</p>

Our focus will be on the extended crisis of faith inaugurated in the West by the Enlightenment, and its ramifications and reflections in literature over succeeding generations. We begin with an essay that presents a poetic version of the philosophical optimism that dominated much of the 17th and early 18th centuries. Pope?s sanguine assessment of the human condition, his unwillingness to recognize impediments to blithe optimism and unbounded faith, are an invitation to the cynical indictments of unreflective belief that will soon ensue. </p>

Focused on the history of the United States, the course will encourage students to think about the social and political implications of capitalist and anti-capitalist ideologies. Readings will examine inequality, work, gender roles, and class and racial hierarchies in the past and today. Authors include Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Franklin Roosevelt, Milton Friedman, Barbara Ehrenreich, and Thomas Piketty.</p>

This course will examine the visual art, poetry and music connected to or inspired by three important and influential world contemplative religious traditions.  Though there are, at some levels, enormous differences between Zen, Sufism and Mystical Christianity, there are also surprising similarities in the aims, methods, approaches, and most importantly, the language used by great practitioners of these traditions.  We will study a selection of primary texts, and since these texts explore religion at an esoteric level, they are very challenging.  </p>

We will also be examining popular fiction and film as way of asking why crime entertains us?and what these entertainments suggest about our cultural obsessions. Texts will include detective novels, graphic novels, films, and cultural criticism.

Our primary course texts will be media coverage of present day events--school closures, the Opt Out movement, student protest related to Black Lives Matter etc.-- and classic texts in the philosophy of education by Plato, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Dewey, and Paulo Freire. Special emphasis will be placed on exploring the function and history of the "school to prison pipeline." Students enrolled in the FYS will also complete a minimum of 10 hours of volunteer work in a Richmond school that partners with the Bonner Center's "Built It" program, and will keep journals that interpret what they see in schools in relation to course readings. The capstone project in the course will be group presentations on topics of the group's choosing that explore particular events or topics related to the course's themes. Rather than present "about" democrac! y and education, this project challenges students to enact the relation, designing a lesson that democratically teaches their chosen content. A substantial portion of the grade for this class comes from group projects and papers.</p>

We will read plays from ancient Greece and, in some cases, their reperforomacne in modern contexts, alongside our screening of a movie or two. We will visit local theaters on at least 3 Friday evenings to emphasize our distinction between, on the one hand, life and live performance - and their happy or unhappy accidents - and, on the other, the artful perfection of texts and films.

Students will learn about and practice different methods of interacting with art, explore different ways of verbally responding to and writing about art, and begin examining how others, specifically critics, historians, and artists, also express their own viewpoints, biases, and insights. As much as possible, students will encounter art in person, utilizing the University Museums? collections, as well as field trips to other museums, galleries, and individual artists? studios. During this class we will ask the following questions: 
?	What preconceived ideas do we bring with us when we engage with art? 
?	How can we recognize these ideas as biases or trained responses and either capitalize upon them or challenge them? 
?	How can we recognize similar agendas or insightful responses in how others, such as critics, curators, historians, and artists, describe their encounters with art? 
?	How can we express our thoughts and reactions to art in ways that acknowledge these approaches?

It will examine the nature of subsequent relationships that resulted from these encounters. The course will look at these ideas as they evolved from the ideals of the Renaissance (humanism) to the conceptual alterations or pushback they led to in the 19th, the 20th and especially the 21st centuries with the rise of new power centers in Asia. The course will start with Montaigne?s ?Of cannibals,? a discourse that ran counter to the main episteme upon which Western society functioned and acted in this endeavor of global explorations. The subsequent texts will be read as arguments between two camps pitting, on the one hand, Europe or Asia as the initiator of the direction of the encounter, on the other hand, a more cautious approach advocated on the ground of ideals of! equality and inclusiveness piloted by the performance on the ground. Mandela?s South Africa will serve as a practical test case.</p>

Woodstock, Vietnam, assassinations, the Beatles and assorted acronyms like ARPANET, NET, NOW, SNCC, and SDS would become part of the cultural lexicon. And through it all Americans flocked to the movies. But was movie popularity only fueled by the need to escape the unsettled world, as it was presented on television, or were the films of the 1960's a means by which people could somehow deal with the upheavals in their lives?</p>

As the art of political decision-making, public policy reflects the reality that: (1) penalties and incentives (?sticks and carrots?) are what primarily drive modern life; (2) information, who has how much of it and when, is key to structuring effective penalties and incentives; and that (3) thinking analytically and empirically, knowing what to measure and how to measure it, is as important as thinking morally.

Morality, in so many words, represents the ideal way that people want (usually others) to behave.  Public policy?influenced by economics, psychology, philosophy, politics, culture, tradition, and religion?reflects essentially the same aspiration, but is based on the way people actually behave. Also, personal opinions are helpful, but operate better as starting points for creating testable theories and arguments about what the best policies are for, say: improving education, strengthening national security, lowering unemployment, increasing health, expanding employment, decreasing poverty, protecting the environment, preventing crime, and consuming limited resources. In its purest form, the goal of any public policy is to make life better for as many people as possible. What makes public policy so challenging and interesting, though, is that people disagree over what constitutes things such as equality, fairness, effectiveness, and causation.  </p>

The United States has a more limited and targeted welfare state than most other wealthy, industrialized countries and has stood out as the only country among its peers without universal access to health care coverage. This course will look at the differences in health care policy and politics between the U.S. and countries such as Canada, Japan, and those of Western Europe. It will cover the comparative historical development of various health care systems and the relative role of the private sector and the government in providing, paying for, and regulating access to health care. It will also look at how recent health care reforms in the U.S. compare with the policies developed in other countries and how various political forces such as organized labor, doctors? organizations, and legislative institutions shape policy.

We will try to understand its multiple causes, specifically whether it was the result of random events, systematic market or regulatory failings, moral failures, or some other cause or causes.  Addressing this question is important if we are to learn from the calamity.  Students from all backgrounds are welcome in the course, even those brand new to economics.

We will use primary texts and Socratic dialogue to address related and controversial questions such as ?Does the market always self-correct?? ?Is unemployment voluntary??  ?Is greed good?? ?How does the invisible hand work??  Early readings emphasize the work of Adam Smith, considered the founder of modern economics and the most famous user of the phrase ?the invisible hand? of the market.  Smith?s meaning is different from modern usage, and provides an important perspective on the economic collapse.

Contrary to popular misconceptions, mathematics is not about computing but about struggling with abstract mathematical concepts and arguing as to what makes them true. The venue for this will be a selection of fascinating abstract mathematical topics from Greek antiquity to the Millennium problems such as: infinity of the primes, bisecting and trisecting angles, Euler's characterization of polyhedral solids, regular polyhedral solids, Fermat's last theorem, the four and five color problems, set theory, notions of infinity, and Goodstein's theorem. We will also discuss questions such as (i) Are mathematical concepts invented or do they already exist and we just discover them? (ii) Who has the burden of proof in a mathematical argument, the author or the reader? (iii) Are some proofs better than others? (iv) Do computer calculations give a satisfying mathematical argument? How do we know the computer was programmed correctly? (v) Does mathematics need to be practical? Since this course emphasizes mathematical writing and arguing, and will not depend on any prior knowledge of calculus or statistics, it will be open to all first-year students.</p>

An investigation of the meaning of, relationship between, and practical value of two prominent, but apparently contradictory precepts of Western moral thought: one which asks us to realize our fullest potential as unique individuals; another which commands us to sacrifice ourselves to some greater good. To achieve this we will (except for the Greeks, where the procedure is reversed) follow a pattern of reading a theoretical statement on one side of the other of the question, then following it with consideration of works, mostly fictional, that test the applicability of such principles to life. Authors to be considered will include Homer, St. Paul, Goethe, J.S. Mill, and Camus.

To Russians, St. Petersburg is much more than just another pretty face. The city lives and breathes the spirit of what makes them and us who we are. Exploring the differences between the myth and reality of Petersburg through the arts locates us in the very place where those differences are born and find expression in the metalanguages of literature, music, and painting. The very process of mythmaking as an alternate reality is where we discover ourselves, our highest aspirations and our darkest fears and the beauty of both.</p>

How are writing and research distinguished across the disciplines? By examining differences and similarities across disciplines, we will take a broad look at the education, research and commitment required for sustained scholarship and read examples of scholars' work, as well as memoirs and autobiographies by scholars that provide narratives of their research lives.</p>

Mid-20th century social movements not only repudiated de jure and de facto segregation, organizers sought to raise minorities' standard of living (as the New Deal had for many white Americans). In time, the American civil rights movement instigated a culture of rights that changed the relationship between Americans and the state. Civil rights legislation  not only protected African Americans, but also America?s women, impoverished, mentally ill, and physical challenged. Yet, we attribute the movement and subsequent civil rights legislation to a handful of activists and policymakers. This course utilizes contemporary literature from the mid-20th century and recent historical scholarship to question the civil rights movement's chronology, organizational strategies, and outcomes. Ultimately, we will interrogate how popular assumptions about the movement have distorted our understanding of civil rights leadership. </p>

Even for those who have never visited, Paris easily conjures recognizable images and reliable stereotypes, from the Eiffel Tower to the Arch of Triumph, and from famous fashion houses to the typical Parisian cafe. In this course, we will challenge this first clich?d version of Paris by contrasting it with another version: Paris as the space of political unrest, social conflict, and protest. Through literary texts, film, newspaper articles, historical documentation, and essays, we will explore the long history of the double life of Paris.

The processes, production, display, and circulation of maps gave way to a "geographic imagination" that constrained both policy and popular culture - in turn, Americans saw their place in the world in very spatialized ways.  From a rhetorical perspective, maps gave us specific and partial perceptions of the globe and cartographers from a host of different institutions and with various national and international interests (government institutions like the State Dept., the CIA, the Department of Defense, academic institutions like the American Geographic Society, popular magazines like National Geographic and Time, and corporations as diverse as Rand McNally and Google) sketched the contours of American identity in both longitude and latitude.  The course teaches students how to critique maps as systems of visual codes and also contextualizes for them how maps are used as rhetorical strategies by American elites and publics; by both the powerful and those challenging the powerful.  Not only then is this a course on cartography; it's a course on the wild world-making processes of U.S. geopolitics and international space.</p>

How does our aural experience of the world differ from our visual experience of the world? How can we be more fully aware of sound, its meanings, and implications? What is the difference between ?sound,? ?noise,? and ?music?? Why are these defined differently between cultures? How would an ?ethics of listening? differ from an ethics based on speaking, acting or logical reasoning? What is the relationship between sound and emotion, and why does that relationship differ between cultures? Why, for instance, does the angklung music of Bali sound joyful to many Americans but is deeply saddening to most Balinese?  Students will have the opportunity to study the traditional musics (on authentic instruments) of several cultures to help illustrate the ways in which the aesthetic ideals of a people are embodied in their music. Ultimately, we will consider the aesthetic, social, and ethical consequences of critical listening. 

No previous musical experience necessary.

This seminar explores the world of work in modern America, using a variety of sources ranging from U.S. Supreme Court opinions to first-person narratives. We will consider workplace questions of rights, social justice, motivation, challenges, social behavior, and economic necessity. Topics include legal foundations of the employment relationship, how that relationship has been modified by the courts and Congress, the broad spectrum of employment situations in which people of all ages perform their work, the dynamics and perils of the work environment, and how the working world has been portrayed by outside observers and employees.
